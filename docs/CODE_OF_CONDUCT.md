## 6. Addressing Challenges and Resolving Disagreements  
Conflicts may arise, and our goal is to resolve them in a fair and professional manner.  

1. **Direct Resolution:** Discuss concerns openly and respectfully with the person involved.  
2. **Team Discussion:** If needed, involve the whole team to find a fair resolution.  
3. **Instructor Mediation:** If an issue remains unresolved, seek guidance from the lecturer.  

Our focus is always on finding solutions and maintaining a positive team environment.  

## 7. Academic Integrity and Ethical Conduct  
We adhere to **university policies on academic integrity** and ensure that:  
- All work submitted is **original and properly cited**.  
- **Plagiarism, collusion, and academic misconduct** are avoided.  
- If unsure about citation practices, team members should **ask for clarification** rather than risk misconduct.  

## 8. Reporting Issues and Seeking Support  
If a team member experiences or witnesses a **breach of this Code of Conduct**, they should:  
- Speak privately with the individuals involved (if comfortable doing so).  
- Bring the issue to the team for discussion and resolution.  
- If needed, escalate the concern to the lecturer for support.  

Reports will be handled with confidentiality and respect.  

## 9. Continuous Improvement  
This Code of Conduct is a **living document**. If any member identifies areas for improvement, they are encouraged to propose changes. Updates will be discussed and agreed upon as a team.  

## 10. Agreement and Commitment  
By participating in this project, each team member **agrees to uphold these principles** and contribute to a **respectful, professional, and effective** team environment.
