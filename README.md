## Overview

PeerRide is a ride-sharing dynamic web application created to make college students' commutes more economical and efficient. By connecting students going in the same direction, the app allows them to carpool to campus, save money on transportation, and lessen their carbon footprint. Through the application, users may connect with neighbouring students, provide or request transportation, and securely communicate.
